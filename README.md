# TimeTraveler: Where Every Call is a Journey Through Time

## About the Project
TimeTraveler is an innovative time travel experience that transports you to different eras and locations with just a few taps. Inspired by sci-fi movies and the timeless allure of time travel, this app lets you:
- **Select a Year & Location:** Instantly travel to any moment and place.
- **Immerse Yourself Visually:** View AI-generated images (using fal.ai's Flux) of historical or futuristic streets from an authentic balcony perspective.
- **Reconnect with Loved Ones:** Choose to call personalized personas like your girlfriend or your homie—each with a rich backstory generated by deepseek and brought to life with ElevenLabs’ lifelike conversation AI.

As a project built for a hackathon, I embraced dual roles as both PM and Tech Lead—reviewing code, troubleshooting regressions, and guiding the development process to create a polished, seamless experience.
